//! Defining extensibility in the ActivityStreams spec
//!
//! In ActivityStreams, there are many times you may want to use an extension. For example, to
//! interact with Mastodon, you need to at least understand the `publicKey` field on their actor
//! type. If not, you won't be able to use HTTP Signatures, and will have your messages rejected.
//!
//! But this library doesn't provide any of the security extensions to ActivityStreams. In order to
//! support it, you could implment your own extensions to this library. Let's cover a basic
//! example.
//!
//! ```rust
//! // For this example, we'll use the Extensible trait, the Extension trait, the Actor trait, and
//! // the Person type
//! use activitystreams::{
//!     actor::{Actor, Person},
//!     ext::{Extensible, Extension},
//! };
//!
//! /// Let's define the PublicKey type. The three fields in this PublicKey struct are how Mastodon
//! /// represents Public Keys on actors. We'll need to derive Serialize and Deserialize for these
//! /// in order for them to be useful.
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
//! #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
//! pub struct PublicKey {
//!     /// The ID of the key.
//!     ///
//!     /// In mastodon, this is the same as the actor's URL with a #main-key on
//!     /// the end.
//!     pub id: String,
//!
//!     /// The ID of the actor who owns this key.
//!     pub owner: String,
//!
//!     /// This is a PEM file with PKCS#8 encoded data.
//!     pub public_key_pem: String,
//! }
//!
//! /// Now, we'll need more than just a PublicKey struct to make this work. We'll need to define a
//! /// second struct that declares the correct key to house this information inside of
//! ///
//! /// The information is represented as the following json:
//! /// ```json
//! /// {
//! ///     "publicKey": {
//! ///         "id": "key id",
//! ///         "owner": "actor id",
//! ///         "publicKeyPem": "pem string"
//! ///     }
//! /// }
//! /// ```
//! ///
//! /// This means we'll need to define the 'publicKey' key
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
//! #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
//! pub struct PublicKeyExtension {
//!     /// The public key's information
//!     pub public_key: PublicKey
//! }
//!
//! impl PublicKey {
//!     /// Let's add a convenience method to turn a PublicKey into a PublicKeyExtension
//!     pub fn to_ext(self) -> PublicKeyExtension {
//!         PublicKeyExtension { public_key: self }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // And finally, we'll implement the Extension trait for PublicKeyExtension
//! //
//! // We'll bound this extension by the Actor trait, since we don't care about non-actors having
//! // keys. This means that you can put a key on a `Person`, but not on a `Video`.
//! impl<T> Extension<T> for PublicKeyExtension where T: Actor {}
//!
//! // Now that these types are defined, we can put them to use!
//! fn main() {
//!     let person = Person::new();
//!
//!     // let's just create a dummy key for this example
//!     let public_key = PublicKey {
//!         id: "My ID".to_owned(),
//!         owner: "Owner ID".to_owned(),
//!         public_key_pem: "My Public Key".to_owned(),
//!     };
//!
//!     // We're doing it! The person is being extended with a public key
//!     //
//!     // Note that calling `extend` on person here is possible because the Extensible trait is in
//!     // scope
//!     let person_with_key = person.extend(public_key.to_ext());
//! }
//! ```

/// Defines an extension to an activitystreams object or link
///
/// This type provides two fields, the first field, `base`, should always the be base
/// ActivityStreams type. As long as `base` implements an ActivityStreams trait, Ext will also.
///
/// For example, the type `Ext<Video, HashMap<String, String>>` will implement the `Object` trait,
/// because `Video` implements that trait.
///
/// Additionally, some level of AsRef and AsMut have been derived for Ext. If type type
/// `Ext<Ext<Follow, SomeTime>, AnotherType>` exists, that will implement
/// `AsRef<ActivityProperties>` just like the innermost `Follow`. This only works for types
/// two levels deep, however.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```rust
/// use activitystreams::object::Video;
///
/// fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
///     let mut video = Video::full();
///
///     // AsMut works even though this is an Ext<Video, ApObjectProperties>
///     video
///         .as_mut()
