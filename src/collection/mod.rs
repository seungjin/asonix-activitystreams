/// A Collection is a subtype of `Object` that represents ordered or unordered sets of `Object` or
/// `Link` instances.
///
/// The items within a Collection can be ordered or unordered. The OrderedCollection type MAY be
/// used to identify a Collection whose items are always ordered. In the JSON serialization, the
/// unordered items of a Collection are represented using the items property while ordered items
/// are represented using the orderedItems property.
///
/// `UnorderedCollection` and `OrderedCollection` types are provided by the `activitystreams-types`
/// crate.

///
/// A `Collection` can contain a large number of items. Often, it becomes impractical for an
/// implementation to serialize every item contained by a `Collection` using the items (or
/// `ordered_items`) property alone. In such cases, the items within a `Collection` can be divided
/// into distinct subsets or "pages". A page is identified using the `CollectionPage` type.
///
/// `UnorderedCollectionPage` and `OrderedCollectionPage` types are provied by the
/// `activitystreams-types` crate.
