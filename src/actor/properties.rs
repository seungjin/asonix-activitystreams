//! Namespace for properties of standard Actor types
//!
//! To use these properties in your own types, you can flatten them into your struct with serde:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use activitystreams::{
//!     actor::{
//!         properties::ApActorProperties,
//!         Actor, ActorBox,
//!     },
//!     object::{
//!         properties::{ApObjectProperties, ObjectProperties},
//!         Object, ObjectBox,
//!     },
//!     PropRefs,
//! };
//! use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, PropRefs)]
//! #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
//! #[prop_refs(Object)]
//! #[prop_refs(Actor)]
//! pub struct MyActor {
//!     #[serde(rename = "type")]
//!     pub kind: String,
//!
//!     /// Define a require property for the MyActor type
//!     pub my_property: String,
//!
//!     #[serde(flatten)]
