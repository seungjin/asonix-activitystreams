/// `Actor` types are `Object` types that are capable of performing activities.
///
/// This specification intentionally defines `Actors` in only the most generalized way, stopping
/// short of defining semantically specific properties for each. All Actor objects are
/// specializations of `Object` and inherit all of the core properties common to all Objects.
/// External vocabularies can be used to express additional detail not covered by the Activity
/// Vocabulary. VCard [[vcard-rdf](https://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf/) SHOULD be used to provide
/// additional metadata for `Person`, `Group`, and `Organization` instances.
///
/// While implementations are free to introduce new types of Actors beyond those defined by the
/// Activity Vocabulary, interoperability issues can arise when applications rely too much on
/// extension types that are not recognized by other implementations. Care should be taken to not
/// unduly overlap with or duplicate the existing `Actor` types.
///
/// When an implementation uses an extension type that overlaps with a core vocabulary type, the
/// implementation MUST also specify the core vocabulary type. For instance, some vocabularies
/// (e.g. VCard) define their own types for describing people. An implementation that wishes, for
/// example, to use a `vcard:Individual` as an `Actor` MUST also identify that `Actor` as a
/// `Person`.
