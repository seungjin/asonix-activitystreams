/// Activity Vocabulary allow values that are either instances of Object or Link. When a Link is
/// used, it establishes a qualified relation connecting the subject (the containing object) to the
/// resource identified by the href. Properties of the Link are properties of the reference as
/// opposed to properties of the resource.
