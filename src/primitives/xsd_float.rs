/// The type xsd:float represents an IEEE single-precision 32-bit floating-point number.
///
/// TODO: handle exponents, infinity, not-a-number
///
/// The format of xsd:float values is a mantissa (a number which conforms to the type decimal)
/// followed, optionally, by the character "E" or "e" followed by an exponent. The exponent must be
/// an integer. For example, 3E2 represents 3 times 10 to the 2nd power, or 300. The exponent must
/// be an integer.
///
/// In addition, the following values are valid: INF (infinity), -INF (negative infinity), and NaN
/// (Not a Number). INF is considered to be greater than all other values, while -INF is less than
/// all other values. The value NaN cannot be compared to any other values, although it equals
/// itself.
