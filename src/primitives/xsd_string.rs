/// A string type that conforms to the xsd:string specification.
///
/// TODO: Escape `<` and `&` when converting
///
/// The type xsd:string represents a character string that may contain any Unicode character
/// allowed by XML. Certain characters, namely the "less than" symbol (<) and the ampersand (&),
/// must be escaped (using the entities &lt; and &amp;, respectively) when used in strings in XML
/// instances.
///
/// The xsd:string type has a whiteSpace facet of preserve, which means that all whitespace
/// characters (spaces, tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds) are preserved by the processor.
/// This is in contrast to two types derived from it: normalizedString, and token.
