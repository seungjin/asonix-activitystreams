//! Traits for Activity Streams
//!
//! These traits don't provide any functionality other than anotations for types created in other
//! projects. See the `activitystreams-types` crate for examples of how these traits could be used.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use activitystreams_traits::{Object, Actor};
//! use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//! use std::any::Any;
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, Deserialize, Serialize)]
//! #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
//! pub struct Persona {
//!     #[serde(rename = "@context")]
//!     context: String,
//!
//!     #[serde(rename = "type")]
//!     kind: String,
//! }
//!
//! #[typetag::serde]
//! impl Object for Persona {
//!     fn as_any(&self) -> &(dyn Any + 'static) {
//!         self
//!     }
//!
//!     fn as_any_mut(&mut self) -> &mut (dyn Any + 'static) {
//!         self
//!     }
//!
//!     fn duplicate(&self) -> Box<dyn Object + 'static> {
//!         Box::new(self.clone())
//!     }
//! }
//! impl Actor for Persona {}
//!
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
