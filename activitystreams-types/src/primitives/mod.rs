//! Types defined as 'primitives' are used as building-blocks for ActivityStreams objects.
//!
//! For example, an `Object` may have a `summary` field, which is defined as a range of
//! `xsd:string` and `rdf:langString`. As code, this is represented as an enum that either
//! contains an `XsdString` or an `RdfLangString`.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use activitystreams_types::primitives::{RdfLangString, XsdString};
//!
//! /// Define a terminating enum for the Summary field in Object Properties
//! ///
//! /// In this case, terminating means it does not contain child elements.
//! pub enum ObjectPropertiesSummaryTermEnum {
//!     XsdString(XsdString),
//!     RdfLangString(RdfLangString),
//! }
//!
//! /// Since summary isn't functional, we can either have a single string, or multiple strings.
//! pub enum ObjectPropertiesSummaryEnum {
//!     Term(ObjectPropertiesSummaryTermEnum),
//!     Array(Vec<ObjectPropertiesSummaryTermEnum>),
//! }
//!
//! /// Define an excerpt from the ObjectProperties struct
//! pub struct ObjectProperties {
//!     // ...
//!
//!     /// Since summary isn't a required field, it's stored as an option
//!     summary: Option<ObjectPropertiesSummaryEnum>,
//!
//!     // ...
//! }
//! #
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
