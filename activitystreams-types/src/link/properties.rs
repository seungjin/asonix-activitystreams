//! ```rust
//! use activitystreams_traits::Link;
//! use activitystreams_types::link::properties::LinkProperties;
//! use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
//! #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
//! pub struct MyLink {
//!     #[serde(rename = "type")]
//!     pub kind: String,

//!     /// Define a require property for the MyLink type
//!     pub my_property: String,
//!
//!     #[serde(flatten)]
//!     pub link_properties: LinkProperties,
//! }
//!
//! impl Link for MyLink {}
