//! ActivityStreams Types
//!
//! This crate defines the base set of types from the Activity Streams specification.
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//! ```rust
//! use activitystreams_types::{context, link::Mention};
//!
//! fn run() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
//!     /// A Mention is the only predefined Link type in the Activity Streams spec
//!     let mut mention = Mention::default();
//!     mention.link_props.set_context_object(context())?;
//!
//!     let mention_string = serde_json::to_string(&mention)?;
//!
//!     let mention: Mention = serde_json::from_str(&mention_string)?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! #     run().unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```

use serde_derive::{Deserialize, Serialize};

/// Define a simple wrapper around a string for this crate's main Context type
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct ContextObject(pub String);

impl activitystreams_traits::Object for ContextObject {}

/// The context associated with all of the Activity Streams types defined in the crate.
pub fn context() -> ContextObject {
    ContextObject("https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams".to_owned())
}
