//! ActivityStreams Types
//!
//! This crate defines the base set of types from the Activity Streams specification.
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//! ```rust
//! use activitystreams_types::{context, link::Mention};
//!
//! fn run() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
//!     /// A Mention is the only predefined Link type in the Activity Streams spec
//!     let mut mention = Mention::default();
//!     mention.as_mut().set_context_xsd_any_uri(context())?;
//!
//!     let mention_string = serde_json::to_string(&mention)?;
//!
//!     let mention: Mention = serde_json::from_str(&mention_string)?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! #     run().unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
